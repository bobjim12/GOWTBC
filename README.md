# GOWTBC

GOWTBC stand for Gears of war turn-based combat.

The characters and weapons referred to in the game are based on those found in the computer game Gears of War (property of Microsoft and The Coalition).

The idea of this game is for 2 players, where after selecting a team of 3 out of the 5 options, to take it in turns to attack the other player's team 
with a variety of weapons that deal different amounts of damage, some weapons come with certain risks, and certain attacks can be challenged depending
on the victim! It is played through the console. I plan to convert this into a GUI based version where you can see your team at all times and click on players and weapons that you want to use on your turn.

I do not own any reference to names used in this game.
